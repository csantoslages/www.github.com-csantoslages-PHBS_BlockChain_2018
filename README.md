## Digital currency and government: What are countries doing?

## 1 Fundamentals of digital currency and government

The first digital currency based on peer-to-peer authentication – Bitcoin –, known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), was conceived by Satoshi Nakamoto, and the paper explaining it was released in 2008 (Dwyer, 2014). It stated that “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.” The project can be considered a construction milestone for its mechanism that allows the transactions, and for the widespread usage of blockchain since then. 

This idea found breeding ground between the Cypherpunk, an online group of people who struggles for privacy under any circumstance, as well as between the libertarians, those who support a political line with maximum individual liberty and minimized government.

According to the [Cyberpunks](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html):
> We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will speak. To try to prevent their speech is to fight against the realities of information 

The same opinion is shared by [libertarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_in_the_United_States):
> They advocate a much smaller government; one that is limited to protecting individuals from coercion and violence. Libertarians tend to embrace individual responsibility, oppose government bureaucracy and taxes, promote private charity, tolerate diverse lifestyles, support the free market, and defend civil liberties. 

Since then, with no government influence or guidance, Bitcoins have been growing substantially and accounted for around 0.13% world`s money, in September 2018. Moreover, Bitcoins inspired the creation of other cryptocurrencies, and, together, they sum US$ 202 bi, as shown in the [figure](https://howmuch.net/articles/worlds-money-in-perspective-2018).

Nevertheless, Bitcoin has failed on behaving as a currency that delivers the three fundamentals aspects of money: i) unit of account, ii) means of payment, and iii) store of value. An illustration of this failure is that even some of the blockchain enthusiasts (Initial [Coin Offering - ICO](https://icobench.com/)) are not willing to be fully sponsored with those coins due to its instability. That happens because of three deep and related problems: the extent of genuine activity is hugely exaggerated; the fraud may be endemic; and technology does not scale well. The main reason for the first problem is that bitcoins owners simply want prices to start rising again, inflating artificially its activity and importance. The fraud, on the other hand, includes ponzi schemes, hacking and collapse on the exchange process[ According to the Anti-Money Laundering Report, criminals stole $1.7 billion of cryptocurrency last year, 3.6 times higher than in 2017 (CipherTrace, 2019). A relevant question is: is this number high proportionally to the total amount of cryptocurrency? The total market cap is [$178.859.392.910](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/), last updated in Apr 19, 2019 8:20 AM UTC, which means that around 0.95% was stolen.  And what is this proportion for the regular currencies, which are also subject to hackers? This is certainly a much more difficult question to answer – what is already a problem by itself –, raising doubt about the safer and more convenient currency.]. Finally, the third one is technical (considering the status quo): the creation of blocks each ten minutes limits the network to processing about seven transactions per second (just to compare, Visa can handle tens of thousands per second). Another criticism concerning the bitcoin is that it is energy-hungry, given its limit of 21 m Bitcoins. During its boom, the electricity consumed was equivalent of Ireland, and now it matches Romania consumption[ The provision of cash is also costly. The value is estimated to be 0.5% of GDP for the euro area, as well as Canada and Uruguay (Griffoli, 2018). Mexico estimates a cost of 3% of the GDP (Forbes, 03/27/2019). Roughly speaking, we could consider that the world spends between 0.5% to 3% of its GDP for issuing and managing cash, and that the amount of energy consumed by country is proportional to its GDP. This being said, [Ireland and Romania’s GDP](http://www.economywatch.com/economic-statistics/economic-indicators/GDP_Share_of_World_Total_PPP/) share of world (PPP) in 2015 were 0.227% and 0.365% . Moreover, Bitcoins are divisible by construction to the eighth digit after the decimal place, which allows for quite a bit of subdivision of units (Dwyer, 2014), much more than the current amount of money available estimated on [US$ 86.5 t](https://howmuch.net/articles/worlds-money-in-perspective-2018). Apparently, the supply is enough to deliver the money’s functions of unit of account and means of payment, although inherently deflationary, and the energy required is reasonable, when compared to the current situation.]. (The Economist, 03/28/2019)

One [contradiction](https://medium.com/bosscrypto/the-great-bitcoin-contradiction-e03f0f268c54) raised in this context where bitcoins are more seen as an investment than unit of trade: nowadays big institutions control most bitcoins for speculation and intermediation, as well as miner[ Actually, the same happens with hackers. 60% of all hacks from exchanges and custodial services in 2018  (over $1 billion) were done by only two prominent professional groups. (CipherTrace, 2019)]. Does the market structure could be considered a monopoly, with the same characteristics attributed to the “financial institution” quoted and abhorred by Satoshi?

Finally, the motivation of this article is to analyses what are the usage of digital currency and DLT made by the government, the powers shaping it, and if it converges to Satoshi’s ideal. I believe digital currency guided by the government has the potential to reduce monopoly distortions, and operational risk, to be more cost efficiency, to provide financial inclusion, besides combating money laundering and tax evasion. It could, in the end, allow monetary integration and reduction of inequality, the biggest threat to the world. 

## 2 What are the powers shaping the role of governments related to digital currency and DLT?

The powers shaping the role of governments related to digital currency and DLT seem to be coming from both inside the government, from its high qualified bureaucracy body of central bank, as well as from the external pressure, coming from the usage of FinTech by individuals and firms. The first qualifies a more active action, with investigations and experiments, and the second a more reactive action, trying to regulate and mitigate the risk of FinTech. We will describe the most relevant investigations or experiments done by the governments.

The consensus is that, although central banks are among the most cautious and prudent institutions in the world, they, surprisingly, are seriously considering Central Bank Digital Currency (GRIFFOLI et all, 2018) and are among the first to implement blockchain technology (WEF, 2019). This fact indicates a trend of trust and acceptance of the technology. The degree and motivations on blockchain technology research varies greatly among central banks. Some have already fully deployed blockchain technology, others are curious and just monitor the activities, and part of them have not demonstrated interest due to other priorities or for considering the DLT still incipient and risky (WEF, 2019).

The first publication on this subject was in 2014, by the Bank of England, and they were fallowed by the central banks of Canada, Singapore, Finland, France, Israel, Korea, Lithuania, Thailand, Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Norway, New Zeeland, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and US[ For a complete relation see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c8iGtoG7BkPr-iufnIPELEWvtZiNtouOyJp2IYjhAEY/edit#). The Bank of England, Canada and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have conducted joint researches on November 2018, as well as the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (WEF, 2019). 

The main fields of those researches are i) the interbank payments and settlements, and ii) the convenience of central bank issuing digital currencies [For detailed use cases for central banks with distributed ledger technology see [here](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Central_Bank_Activity_in_Blockchain_DLT.pdf). However, the usage of blockchain technology is not limited by just those ones and upcoming is expected.

Considering the first subject, its purpose consists on improving the liquidity management efficiency, and having a safer, more transparent and decentralized transactions.

The CBDC pilots consist on:
> (…) the central bank issues digital tokens on a distributed ledger that represent, and are redeemable for, central bank reserves in the domestic currency held in a separate account with the central bank. The agents in the system use the CBDC to make interbank transfers that are validated and settled on the distributed ledger.
The central banks typically use “permissioned” blockchain network implementations, whereby participants are limited and must be granted access to participate in the network and view the set of transactions. In contrast, major “permissionless” blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, allow public participation and full transaction viewability. Both permissioned and permissionless networks can add privacy and confidentiality features to mask transaction details where appropriate.
The central bank chooses, according to suitability and availability, the type of network and its internal mechanisms (most importantly, the decentralized consensus mechanism the network uses for participants to reach agreement on valid transactions). R3’s Corda, the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric, J.P. Morgan’s Quorum, or a simple private configuration of the Ethereum blockchain network are the most popular implementations used by central banks. (WEF, 2019, page 5)

The jurisdictions where retail CBDCs are being actively explored are Australia, Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, China, Curação and Sint Maarten, Eastern Caribbean, Ecuador, Israel, Norway, Philippines, Sweden, United Kingdon and Uruguay (Griffoli at all, 2018). 

The purposes of the second research subject are more diversified and consider financial inclusion, payments efficiency, cyber resilience, trade finance, and others. It is important to consider that the digital currencies researched are not necessarily based on DLT, like the e-krona, from Sweden. The digital currency issued by central banks would be equivalent to – and redeemable for – its domestic currency, often simultaneously removing the equivalent amount of currency from the money supply. (WEF, 2019)

The cases of France, Mexico and Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan (MENAP) and Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) are relevant experiments leaded by the governments from different regions, an evidence of how worldwide the initiatives are.

The Bank of France has a blockchain-based solution for the provisioning and sharing of Single Euro Payments Area Credit Identifiers (SCIs) in a coordinated way with multiple banks. All the manual and time-intensive process were automatized and digitized. (WEF, 2019) Similar practices seem to be the most widespread between central banks.

In Mexico more than half the population is out of the bank system and the government intend to make financial services more affordable through phone-based baking, called CoDi[ For more information see [here](http://www.banxico.org.mx/sistemas-de-pago/codi-cobro-digital-banco-me.html). Others goals of this application are to reduce the use of cash in the country's monetary transactions, which implies a cost of 3% of Mexico GDP, and reduce crimes, such as money laundering and tax evasion (Forbes, 2019). Two main obstacles were, firstly, to require help from the very same banks that for decades have shut out low-income Mexicans with pricey fees, and, secondly,to provide basic infrastructure for cell phone and internet coverage (Reuters, 2019). Indeed, no relevant private mobile payment application operates in Mexico. The adoption of the technology will be voluntary in the begging, and, after having the platform completely operational, make it mandatory in the last quarter of 2019.

Last, the experience of the growing interest in issuing national digital currencies encrypted on blockchain by the MENAP and CCA countries is described by Lukonga (2018):
> Tunisia issued a national digital currency (the E-dinar) in 2015 and subsequently put the E-dinar on blockchain. The UAE (Dubai), in 2017, launched a blockchain based encrypted digital currency called emCash and has been working with Saudi Arabia's central bank to issue a digital currency that would be accepted in cross-border transactions between the two countries. Efforts to develop a national cryptocurrency on blockchain are also advanced in Iran where cryptocurrencies are in high demand to counter the underdevelopment of the digital financial instruments caused by sanctions. Lebanon has also indicated interest in issuing national digital currencies. In the CCA, Kazakhstan has indicated plans to issue a national cryptocurrency. (Lukonga, 2018, page 10)

Finally, the second power shaping the government role mentioned above is external. A revolution on the financial industry is being done by the FinTech, but without the government heading it, although, in some cases, helped by reforms. And it is happening not only on developed countries, with their already well stablished bank systems, but mainly in the developing ones, fulfilling the lack of provision of traditional financial services.

The FinTech induces CBDC adoption in advanced economies in order to regulate the growth of private forms of money, which could cause operational risk and monopoly distortions, as well as reduce the cash on circulation.

The effect of FinTech on bottom of the income pyramid is different. The spread of this technology is explained by the lack of the ordinary financial services. In 2017, there were 6 ATMs per 100,000 adults in the Sub-Saharan Africa. These numbers for Low & Middle Income and High Income were 27 and 68, respectively. Traditional banks also have no interest, or the Sub-Saharan Africa countries cannot provide enough structure for their installation. There is only 1 commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults in SSA, while there are 9 and 20 ones for Low & Middle and Income High Income, respectively. They remain almost a mirage for Africans. (Amadou N. R. et al, 2018) 

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has, then, become the global leader in mobile money (mobile money accounts per-capita, both registered and active accounts, mobile money outlets, and volume of mobile money transactions), spurring widespread access to financial services, with 40 out of 45 sub-Saharan African countries actively using this new financial technology. (Amadou N. R. et al, 2018)

The most relevant experience is the M-Pesa, a mobile payments system that started in Kenya in 2007 and now boasts 30 million users in Albania, D.R. Congo, Egypt, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, Romania, and Tanzania. The market is not limited by only this company. Paga, SimbaPay, MTN Money, Mowali, Zoona, Wizzit, Wizall, GetBucks and Orange Money also operate around the continent. Some devices enable interoperable payments across Africa, like Mowali, and to other continents, like Simbapay, which users can send money to China. Furthermore, financial service (formal saving, loan, and insurance products) are also provide by partnering with banks.( Amadou N. R. et al, 2018)

The same phenomenon can be seen in Asian countries and the case of the National Bank of Cambodia is illustrative. On the second half of 2019, Cambodia will employ blockchain technology in its national payments systems for use by consumers and commercial banks. It is expected an increase in the financial inclusion and improvement on baking system efficiency. The Cambodians nowadays face a mix of trade tools, including cash (both in US dollars and Cambodian riel), and mobile-phone based private payment applications, which are incompatible and do not allow transferring money between them. The solution settled is via commercial banks and is designed to operate with private mobile payment applications and commercial bank account. (WEF, 2019) The interesting part is that the National Bank of Cambodia does not discouraged the FinTech industry nor the traditional bank services, only allowed them to grow efficiently and integrated.

However, the FinTech industry has limits on expanding the access, and can rise financial risk if not well regulated. The Financial Stability Board (2017)[ For more details on benefits and risks of FinTech see [here](http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/R270617.pdf) pointed out the benefits and risks of the financial technology, resumed by Amadou N. R. et al (2018) as:

Benefits | Risks
--- | ---
Encourages decentralization and diversification, dampening the effects of financial shocks in the event of a failure of an institution. | Vulnerability of financial technology firms to micro-financial risks, stemming from both financial (such as maturity mismatch, liquidity mismatch, and leverage) and operational (such as governance, cyber, and common third-party reliance) sources.
Increases transparency and enables risks to be more accurately assessed and better price. | Propagation to the rest of the financial sector through unforeseen channels.
Improves financial inclusion of households and small businesses. | Exacerbation of system-wide macro-financial risks, such as contagion, procyclicality, or excess volatility, which can amplify shocks to the financial system.

Consequently, police makers are being encouraged by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group (2018)[ One example is the Bali FinTech Agenda launched by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group in October 2018, “a set of 12 policy elements aimed at helping member countries to harness the benefits and opportunities of rapid advances in financial technology that are transforming the provision of banking services, while at the same time managing the inherent risks.” IMF Press release n. [18/388](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/10/11/pr18388-the-bali-FinTech-agenda) to take advantages of the FinTech industry and blockchain technology as a hole, and seriously consider FinTech as an opportunity to foster economic growth and development. (Amadou N. R. et al, 2018) The broadly steps to be taken are specified below:

The Central Bank should, then, design and regulate money, what includes the private ones, in order to satisfy the user needs and social criteria. (Griffoli, 2018)

The user and social needs, and central bank goals can be defined as:
* unit of account: to guarantee price stability;
* means of payment: to maximize liquidity, scalability, acceptance and extra services, and to minimize transaction and disclosure cost, as well as the settlement risk;
* store of value: to maximize returns and to minimize the risks od theft, loss and default of the money issuer.

Finally, three macro goals are desirable:
* financial integrity;
* financial stability; and
* monetary policy effectiveness.

Griffoli (2018) scored each of these criterion to enable comparison between the money providers:

Source: Griffoli (2018), page 38.

Clearly, cryptocurrencies are those which less satisfy the central bank goals. On the other hand, CDBC seems to provide better service for individual needs and social purposes. WEF (2019) enumerates the Pros and Cons of CDBS:

Source:  WEF (2019), page 9

## Conclusion

Finally, a consensus in the literature of CBDC is that it could be the next milestone in the evolution of money, and each country should consider its singularity in order to better optimize its institutional arrangement and the technology.

The benefits of the diffusion of CBDC may go beyond the country borders, and could contribute to the unification of the financial system. It would certain require a lower level of autonomy from the countries. However, the gains in transparency and convergence into a more equal society justify its employment.

Last, the word “government” or “state” or any synonymous is not found on the famous “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” published by Nakamoto. And ironically for the sponsors of the idea, the government seems to play a role on the dissemination of Satoshi ideology. Bitcoins, altcoins and the raise of FinTech industry allowed or inspired governments to use Distributed Ledger Technology, as well as to institutionalize CBDC. Finally, there are evidences that an interest-bearing CBDC increases financial inclusion and diminishes demand for cash, while decreasing bank [profits](https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2018/2018-026.pdf), what may be the closest – though still quite far – of what Satoshi had in mind.
